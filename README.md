# Basic Background Information

## Online Music Emotion Survey

With the purpose of collecting data from all around the world, a survey consisting of three-minute instrumental renditions of twelve ragas was conducted online. These ragas, played on a stringed instrument (sarod), were digitally recorded in both the alaap and gat stages. The task of the participants was to listen to the raga excerpts and rate their emotional experience on Likert scales of 0-4 (0 being ‘not at all felt’ to 4 being ‘felt the most’ for eight emotion labels: happy, romantic, devotional, calm/soothed, angry, longing/yearning, tensed/restless, and sad. 

The ragas selected for the study were played by a professional musician on sarod (a stringed instrument) digitally recorded in alaap and gat. The sarod was tuned by the artist to just intonation scale with the tonic being at 261.5 Hz.  The emotion labels used in the study were translated to Hindi and transliterated to Roman. The emotion labels used along with the respective translation to Hindi are as follows: happy (khush), romantic (premmaye), devotional (bhaktipurn), calm/soothed (shant), angry (krodhit), longing/yearning (virahapurn), tensed/restless (bechain), and sad (udas). The Romanized transliteration was used as it is widely used in internet communication and global commerce.  

## Experimental Design

The raga excerpts heard by participants of the online survey were presented in alternating alaap and gat blocks.  The experiment consisted of four such blocks with each block consisting of six ragas.  The presentation of alaap or gat block as the first block was counterbalanced across subjects.  The order of presentation of ragas within each block was randomized across participants.  The participants were given an option to opt out of the survey after rating at least two blocks (i.e., 12 ragas – six alaap and six gat).  The survey was made available at [here](https://nandinisingh.wixsite.com/labweb/musicemotion).

## Participant Demographics

650 participants registered for the survey over the period of two years; however, only data from participants who completed at least half the survey (i.e., rated at least six alaap excerpts (out of 12) and six gat excerpts (out of 12)) was considered for analysis.  Thus, the analysis reported in this study is based on the emotional responses reported by 255 participants (118 males, 137 females), 143 enculturated and 112 non-enculturated.  Out of the 143 enculturated participants, 122 overlapped with a previous study.The participants were asked to give demographic details before starting the survey. The participants residing in India who reported their native language as one of the languages specified in Indian constitution (Hindi, Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Punjabi, Konkani, Sindhi, Oriya, and Urdu) were considered enculturated. The participants from the following countries, United States (18), UK (13), Hungary (62), France (3), Germany (3), Italy (2), Japan (2), Korea (1), Romania (1), Spain (2), and the Netherlands (3), not specified (2) were classified into the non-enculturated group.
